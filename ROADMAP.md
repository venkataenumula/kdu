# Roadmap (short)

      Arch awareness: ARM32/ARM64 register names & EABI calling notes (the guide’s PC/PSR examples and ARM register mapping). 
      
      “Code:” bytes view with the instruction highlighted at the offset. 
      
      Call trace symbolication for each frame (System.map & DWARF).
      
      Crash dump (vmcore) support later via libkdumpfile/crash JSON export (out of MVP scope).
      
      Hints engine: flag common patterns (NULL deref, bad function pointer, use-after-free).
      
      Markdown/JSON reports suitable for tickets.
